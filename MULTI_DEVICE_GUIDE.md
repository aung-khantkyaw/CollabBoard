# 🌍 Multi-Device Deployment Guide

## Overview

Your CollabBoard project is **fully designed for multi-device collaboration**! Multiple users can connect from different computers (Windows, Mac, Linux) to the same server and collaborate in real-time.

## ✅ Confirmed Multi-Device Features

### Real-Time Synchronization
- **Drawing Operations**: All drawing actions sync instantly across devices
- **Chat Messages**: Text messages appear on all connected clients immediately  
- **File Sharing**: Files uploaded from one device are accessible to all users
- **User Presence**: See who's online from any device
- **Audio Controls**: Voice session management across devices

### Cross-Platform Support
- **Windows**: Full support with Swing GUI
- **Mac**: Native Java support with proper UI rendering
- **Linux**: Complete compatibility with all distributions

## 🚀 Quick Multi-Device Setup

### Step 1: Set Up Server (One Device)

Choose one computer as the server (usually the most powerful or most stable connection):

```bash
cd CollabBoard
gradle build

# Start the server
gradle runServer
```

**Get the server's IP address:**
```bash
# Windows
ipconfig

# Mac/Linux  
ifconfig
# Example output: 192.168.100.28
```

### Step 2: Connect Clients (All Other Devices)

From any other device on the same network:

```bash
# Connect to the server
gradle runClient -Dserver.host=192.168.100.28

# Alternative: Pass as command line argument
java -cp build/classes/main com.collabboard.client.RMIClient 192.168.100.28
```

## 🏗️ Network Configuration

### For Home/Office Networks (Same WiFi)

**Server Setup:**
1. Make sure all devices are on same WiFi network
2. Server IP is typically: `192.168.1.x` or `192.168.0.x`
3. Port 1099 should be available

**Client Connection:**
```bash
# All clients use the same server IP
gradle runClient -Dserver.host=192.168.100.28
```

### For Internet Deployment (Remote Users)

**Server Setup (Cloud/VPS):**
1. Deploy server on cloud instance (AWS, Google Cloud, etc.)
2. Configure security groups to allow port 1099
3. Use public IP address

**Client Connection:**
```bash
# Connect to public server
gradle runClient -Dserver.host=your-server.com
# or
gradle runClient -Dserver.host=203.0.113.42
```

### Firewall Configuration

**Windows (Server):**
```bash
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="CollabBoard RMI" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=1099
```

**Mac (Server):**
```bash
# System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Firewall > Options
# Allow Java application through firewall
```

**Linux (Server):**
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo ufw allow 1099/tcp

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=1099/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

## 🔧 Testing Multi-Device Setup

### Verification Steps

1. **Start Server:**
   ```bash
   gradle runServer
   # Should show: "Server started on port 1099"
   ```

2. **Test Network Connectivity:**
   ```bash
   # From client device, test if server is reachable
   telnet 192.168.100.28 1099
   # or
   ping 192.168.100.28
   ```

3. **Connect First Client:**
   ```bash
   gradle runClient -Dserver.host=192.168.100.28
   # Should show connection success and open GUI
   ```

4. **Connect Second Client:**
   ```bash
   # From different device
   gradle runClient -Dserver.host=192.168.100.28
   # Should see both users in user list
   ```

5. **Test Real-Time Sync:**
   - Draw on one device → should appear on all others
   - Send chat message → should appear on all devices
   - Upload file → should be visible to all users

### Troubleshooting Multi-Device Issues

**"Connection Refused" Error:**
- Check server is running
- Verify IP address is correct
- Check firewall settings
- Ensure port 1099 is not blocked

**"User List Not Updating":**
- Verify callback interfaces are working
- Check network stability
- Restart both server and clients

**"Drawing Not Syncing":**
- Check network latency
- Verify all clients connected to same server
- Test with simple shapes first
